# Icon Libraries as Web Components

**@dile/iconlib** is a Web Components implementation of some icon libraries like [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev) or [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). 

This package allows you to use the icons as **standard JavaScript Web Components**, without depending on any framework.

Find the documentation on the [Dile components icons page](https://dile-components.com/icons/).
