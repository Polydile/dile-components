# Dile Icons

**Dile Icons** is a Web Components implementation of the [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev) library — a beautiful, consistent set of open-source icons.
This package allows you to use Lucide icons as **standard JavaScript Web Components**, without depending on any framework.

---

## 🚀 Installation

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install @dile/iconlib
```

---

## 📦 Usage

Each icon is available as an independent Web Component that can be imported individually.

### Example

```js
import '@dile/iconlib/lucide-icons/house.js';
```

Then use it directly in your HTML:

```html
<dile-lucide-icon-house></dile-lucide-icon-house>
```

That’s it — the icon will render inline
