<h1>Lib Components and mixins</h1>
<p>
  @dile/lib is a package that contains components for easily creating apps, integrating common features with minimal effort.
</p>
<p>
  This library contains a collection of tools for frontend application development. Its goal is to cover areas such as feedback message handling, user management, and making it easier to develop routes in the routing system, among others.
</p>

<h2>What does @dile/lib offer?</h2>
<p>This package provides a set of core features for applications, including:</p>
<dile-card class="mb-3">
  <h3 class="mt-1">1) Redux slices for managing basic application features:</h3>
  <ul class="mb-1">
  <li><code>UserSlice</code>, for user management</li>
  <li><code>FeedbackSlice</code>, for handling feedback messages and loading states</li>
  </ul>
</dile-card>
<dile-card class="mb-3">
  <h3 class="mt-1">2) Components that work with the Redux store:</h3>
  <ul class="mb-1">
  <li>Components for displaying feedback messages</li>
  <li>Components for showing loading indicators</li>
  </ul>
</dile-card>
<dile-card class="mb-3">
  <h3 class="mt-1">3) Components to help with routing system features:</h3>
  <ul class="mb-1">
  <li>A route guard that protects components from unauthorized access, redirecting to a configurable route when the user is not authenticated or lacks the required permissions</li>
  <li>Link components that activate the routing system when clicked</li>
  </ul>
</dile-card>
<dile-card class="mb-3">
  <h3 class="mt-1">4) Utility mixins:</h3>
  <ul class="mb-1">
  <li>For navigation using the routing system</li>
  <li>To remove boilerplate code related to routing</li>
  <li>To easily send feedback messages and loading states</li>
  <li>To sync components with the Redux store</li>
  </ul>
</dile-card>
<h2>Dependencies of @dile/lib</h2>
<p>
  While other components and utilities from Dile Components are designed to work independently, without enforcing a specific technology stack beyond Web Components and Lit, <code>@dile/lib</code> does define a couple of extra key dependencies that must be used to unlock its full potential:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Redux and Redux Toolkit</li>
<li>Lit Router</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In any case, by using this library of modules, components, and mixins, starting a new app will be much faster than building everything from scratch. The benefits clearly justify the additional dependencies added to your project.
</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>To start using <code>@dile/lib</code>, you need to install the package:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install @dile/lib</code></pre>

<h3>Redux Implementation Guides</h3>
<p>
  Once installed, we recommend beginning with Redux implementation in your application, using the store generation utilities provided by this library.
</p>
<p>
  You can find more information on the <a href="/lib/redux-implementation/">Redux implementation page</a>.

<h3>Routing Guides</h3>

<p>
  If you’re developing a frontend SPA application where you’ll implement a routing system, <b>@dile/lib</b> offers a mixin to register routes conveniently.
