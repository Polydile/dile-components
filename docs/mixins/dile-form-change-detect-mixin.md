# DileFormChangeDetect

This mixin detects changes in a form and emmit a ```dile-form-changed``` event when it occurs.

To detect changes the form elements should emmit a ```element-changed``` event. for this reason, this mixins only works with custom elements that have this custom event implemented.

> You could use the [DileEmmitChangeMixin](/mixins/dile-emmit-change-mixin) to send the ```element-changed``` custom event easily.

Also, for this mixin do its work depends on the [DileFormMixin](/mixins/dile-form-mixin), so you need to implement both mixins.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @dile/ui
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { DileFormChangeDetect, DileForm } from '@dile/ui/mixins/form';

export class FctCrudFilters extends 
  DileFormChangeDetect(DileForm(LitElement)) {

    // Code of your component...
    
}
```
