# About Dile Components || 20

Hi!! Thanks for reach the Dile Components!! 

Dile Components is a Web Components library to solve common needs when developing sites and applications. All the components are organized in a [monorepo in GitHub](https://github.com/polydile/dile-components) and published on npm inside the @dile organization.

Our components are mainly based on [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/), a lightweight library from the @Polymer team. 

Follow [@DileComponents](https://twitter.com/DileComponents) on Twitter to stay informed of our component releases.
