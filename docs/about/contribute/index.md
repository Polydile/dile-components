Feel free to contribute in Dile Components library.

We manage our packages in a [Lerna monorepo](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), so is important to know how to bootstrap a Lerna project. This is explained by our [main README.md file](https://github.com/Polydile/dile-components).

Please find a complete [guide to contributing on Dile components on GitHub](https://github.com/Polydile/dile-components/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
