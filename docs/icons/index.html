<h1>Icon libraries Web Components catalog</h1>
<p>
  Here we have native components based on the Web Components standard that let you use popular icon libraries in a convenient and developer-friendly way.
</p>
<p>
  Through these components, you can easily integrate icon libraries like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons">Material icons</a>, <a href="https://lucide.dev/">Lucide Icons</a> or <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a> using simple HTML tags that wrap the SVGs. This allows you to style the icons (color, size, etc.) comfortably with CSS custom properties.
