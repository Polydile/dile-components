<h1>Crud Components</h1>
<p>
  @dile/crud is a package that contains components for easily creating dynamic CRUD systems with a rich user experience.
</p>
<p>
  It is a collection of components designed generically so that adaptable CRUD systems can be created for most web
  services based on REST APIs.
</p>

<h2>How to use the Crud Components</h2>

<p>The CRUD components in this package are based on a well-known frontend library for making asynchronous connections to
  web services, called <a href="https://axios-http.com/">Axios</a>.</p>
<p>Each project may require different Axios configurations, so this package is open to various setups to adapt to the
  needs
  of each application.</p>
<p>
  A default Axios configuration may be implemented within the library using the <code>AxiosInstanceBuilder</code> class. 
</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { AxiosInstanceBuilder } from '@dile/crud/lib/AxiosInstanceBuilder';
new AxiosInstanceBuilder();
</code></pre>
<p>After that, you can import all the components from the library that you need.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import '@dile/crud/components/ajax/ajax.js';
import '@dile/crud/components/ajax-form/ajax-form.js';
</code></pre>

<h2>How to customize the Axios instance</h2>

<p>
  There are two possible alternatives to customize the Axios instance that the components will use.
</p>


<h3>ALTERNATIVE 1: Use your own Axios instance</h3>
<p>The first alternative is to create your own Axios instance using your JavaScript code.</p>
<p>To generate it, you can refer to the Axios library. We simply require you to place the Axios instance in the
  browser's
  <code>window</code> object.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">window.axios = myConfiguredAxiosInstance;
</code></pre>
<p>This is useful because some frameworks, like Laravel, include an Axios instance by default in the <code>window</code>
  object of the
  browser, which is already perfectly configured for tasks like sending csrf tokens via Ajax.</p>
<p>It is also useful if you are familiar with Axios and prefer to create your own instance, fully customized to your needs.</p>
<h3>ALTERNATIVE 2: Create a new Axios instance</h3>
<p>If you wish, we can assist you in easily creating the Axios instance using a minimal configuration. For this purpose,
  the package includes a class called <code>AxiosInstanceBuilder</code> that allows for comfortable configuration.</p>
<p>To use this class, you simply need to import it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { AxiosInstanceBuilder } from '@dile/crud/lib/AxiosInstanceBuilder';
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we can create the Axios instance by creating an instance of the class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">new AxiosInstanceBuilder();
</code></pre>
<p>The Axios instance created this way will be configured in a basic manner, simply ensuring that the necessary headers
  are
  sent to the server to make XMLHttpRequest requests and expect JSON responses.</p>
<p>We can also set up a more specific configuration object ourselves and pass it as a parameter to the constructor of
  the
  <code>AxiosInstanceBuilder</code> class.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let configuration = {
  baseURL: 'http://localhost',
  withCredentials: true,
  withXSRFToken: false,
};

new AxiosInstanceBuilder(configuration);
</code></pre>
<p>In the above case, the configuration object used to create the Axios instance would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  headers: {
    'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
  },
  baseURL: 'http://localhost',
  withCredentials: true,
  withXSRFToken: false,
}
</code></pre>
